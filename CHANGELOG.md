## Upgrade Guide

### Upgrading from 1.x to 2.0

Version 2.0 includes breaking changes due to React Router v6 upgrade and architectural changes.

#### Breaking Changes

1. **React Router v6**

   ```javascript
   // Old (v5)
   import { useHistory } from 'react-router-dom';
   const history = useHistory();
   history.push('/settings');

   // New (v6)
   import { useNavigate } from 'react-router-dom';
   const navigate = useNavigate();
   navigate('/settings');
   ```

2. **Audio Service**

   ```javascript
   // Old (react-use-audio-player)
   import { useAudioPlayer } from 'react-use-audio-player';
   const { load, play } = useAudioPlayer();

   // New (custom service)
   import { useAudioManager } from './hooks/useAudioManager';
   const { load, play } = useAudioManager();
   ```

3. **Redux Actions**

   ```javascript
   // Old (multiple dispatches)
   dispatch(setTimerMode('shortBreak'));
   dispatch(incrementCycleCount());

   // New (composite action)
   dispatch(advanceCycle());
   ```

#### Migration Steps

1. Update dependencies:

   ```bash
   npm install
   ```

2. Update Router usage in custom components (if any)

3. Update audio management (if customized)

4. Test all features thoroughly

5. Review new documentation for best practices
