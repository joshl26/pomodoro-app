# settingsSlice State and Reducers Documentation

## State Structure

- `pomodoro` (number): Pomodoro duration in minutes (default 25)
- `short` (number): Short break duration in minutes (default 5)
- `long` (number): Long break duration in minutes (default 15)
- `autostart` (boolean): Whether timer auto-starts on mode change
- `timermode` (number): Current timer mode (1 = pomodoro, 2 = short break, 3 = long break)
- `currenttime` (number): Current timer duration in minutes (syncs with mode)
- `totalseconds` (number): Total seconds for current timer
- `secondsleft` (number): Seconds left in current timer
- `cycle` (array): Array representing the cycle sequence (default `[1,2,1,2,1,2,1,2,3]`)
- `counter` (number): Index into `cycle` array (0-based)
- `cyclecomplete` (boolean): Whether the current cycle is complete
- `cyclestarted` (boolean): Whether the cycle has started
- `cyclepaused` (boolean): Whether the cycle is paused
- `buttonsound` (boolean): Whether button sounds are enabled
- `alarmenabled` (boolean): Whether alarm sound is enabled
- `alarmsound` (string): Selected alarm sound name
- `alarmvolume` (number): Alarm volume (0.0 to 1.0)

## Reducers

- `setDefault`: Reset all settings to default values
- Increment/Decrement duration actions for pomodoro, short, and long timers with clamping
- Basic setters for autostart, cycle paused, timer mode (with validation)
- `setCurrentTimeFromMode`: Sync `currenttime` with `timermode`
- Cycle counter management: set, increment, decrement with wrapping
- Cycle state flags: complete, started, paused
- Cycle array replacement with validation
- Alarm and button sound settings: enable/disable, volume, sound selection
- Seconds left and total seconds setters with validation

## Notes

- Reducers are pure and use Immer for immutable updates
- Validation and clamping prevent invalid state
- Composite actions (thunks) recommended for complex workflows (e.g., mode switch + reset)
- Selectors should be created for consistent state access
